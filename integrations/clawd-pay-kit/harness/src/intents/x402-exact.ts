import type { HarnessScenario } from "../contracts";

// Canonical x402 `exact` intent scenarios. The harness contract (env
// vars, ready/result JSON shapes, capabilities) mirrors the Rust spine
// (`rust/crates/x402/src/bin/harness_{client,server}.rs`). The matrix
// pairs each x402 client against each x402 server registered in
// `implementations.ts`; the default-matrix pair set is restricted in
// `test/x402-exact.e2e.test.ts` while the TS reference adapter ships
// without a full Solana signing path. Adding language adapters that
// carry a real PaymentProof expands the matrix.
//
// Reject codes (cross-server portability / replay / network mismatch)
// reuse the canonical L6 set declared in `canonical-codes.ts`; the
// matrix asserts each x402 server adapter classifies the failure
// to the same canonical snake_case code as every other adapter.
